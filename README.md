# Ascent diagramer

Diagramer microservice for the Ascent tool, that builds a diagram from a Bill of Materials JSON definition.

## Building locally

To get started building this application locally, you can either run the application natively or use the [IBM Cloud Developer Tools](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cloud-cli-getting-started) for containerization and easy deployment to IBM Cloud.

### Native application development

* Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (NOTE: If python3 is installed in your environment, substite pip3 for pip below)
* Install Graphviz (Mac OS: `brew install graphviz`)
 
Running Flask applications has been simplified with a `manage.py` file to avoid dealing with configuring environment variables to run your app. From your project root, you can download the project dependencies with (NOTE: If you don't have pipenv installed, execute: `pip install pipenv`):

```bash
pipenv install
```

Then, activate this app's virtualenv:

```bash
pipenv shell
```

To run your application locally, run this inside the virtualenv:

```bash
python manage.py start
```

`manage.py` offers a variety of different run commands to match the proper situation:
* `start`: starts a server in a production setting using `gunicorn`.
* `run`: starts a native Flask development server. This includes backend reloading upon file saves and the Werkzeug stack-trace debugger for diagnosing runtime failures in-browser.
* `livereload`: starts a development server via the `livereload` package. This includes backend reloading as well as dynamic frontend browser reloading. The Werkzeug stack-trace debugger will be disabled, so this is only recommended when working on frontend development.
* `debug`: starts a native Flask development server, but with the native reloader/tracer disabled. This leaves the debug port exposed to be attached to an IDE (such as PyCharm's `Attach to Local Process`).

There are also a few utility commands:
* `build`: compiles `.py` files within the project directory into `.pyc` files
* `test`: runs all unit tests inside of the project's `test` directory

Your application is running at: `http://localhost:3002/` in your browser.
- Your [Swagger UI](http://swagger.io/swagger-ui/) is running on: `/explorer`
- Your Swagger definition is running on: `/swagger/api`
- Health endpoint: `/health`

There are two different options for debugging a Flask project:
1. Run `python manage.py runserver` to start a native Flask development server. This comes with the Werkzeug stack-trace debugger, which will present runtime failure stack-traces in-browser with the ability to inspect objects at any point in the trace. For more information, see [Werkzeug documentation](http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/).
2. Run `python manage.py debug` to run a Flask development server with debug exposed, but the native debugger/reloader turned off. This grants access for an IDE to attach itself to the process (i.e. in PyCharm, use `Run` -> `Attach to Local Process`).

You can also verify the state of your locally running application using the Selenium UI test script included in the `scripts` directory.

> **Note for Windows users:** `gunicorn` is not supported on Windows. You may start the server with `python manage.py run` on your local machine or build and start the Dockerfile.

## Limitations
Currently, a default bom.yaml is rendered from `/public/bom.yaml`, and there is not an upload capability or ability to specify an alternative location for the input bom. To render other bom's, place the bom.yaml in /public and change the file name in routes/diagram.py from "bom.yaml" to your new file name.
